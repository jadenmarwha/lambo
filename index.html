Panning the View:

Click and drag your mouse in any direction to pan across the expansive scene. On mobile, gently swipe your finger to smoothly scan over new vistas. Move slowly to fully take in the scope of your surroundings, or quickly whip around to disorient yourself and reveal unseen angles. There are always fresh perspectives to uncover if you keep dragging with no restraint through this world. Thats all there is to it - simple clicking and dragging as you please to control everything the eye can see.
